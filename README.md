# Hello there 👋
I'm Marvin, aka Marfien. Welcome to my profile page! Take a look around. Almost all of my repos are public :)

## Who am I?
Currently, I am doing a dual-degree programm to become a mathematical-technical software engineer (MATSE or MaTechSe) at the FH-Aachen. 

Although my training is about software engineering, I am way more interessted in devops and platform engineering; Tl:dr anything which has potential to maximize DX (developer experience) 📈

When I am not at university, I am working at @Soptim AG in various teams.
In my free time i will most likely either be programming 💻, lifting weights 🏋️‍♂️ or doing judo 🥋 (and sometimes just chilling watching youtube and co).

### 🤓 Tech I'm into 
- Background in Java, some Python and a pinch of Kotlin and GoLang (literally just a pinch)
- Docker, Kubernetes and more
- Selfhosting in my homelab utilizing Terraform to bootstrap flux onto a HA k3s cluster provisioned by Rancher and backed by Harvester :P
- ✨ Pieline magic ✨, mainly in Gitlab CI, preferably GitHub Actions
- Just a bit of frontend (Shoutout to [Hyperplexed](https://www.youtube.com/c/Hyperplexed) who made to made that stuff actually interessting 😎)

### 📚 Stuff I want to lean some time
- Cloud ☁️ computing (preferably GCP, might be AWS)
- More in depth networking
- Software Architecture & Team/Project management

### 👀 Sounds interessting to me
- Rust
- Swift

### 🏎️ My daily drivers
- NeoVim & Jetbrains IDEs
- HyperJS, zsh and oh-my-zsh on the shell-side of life
- Arc by TBC <3 (or Chrome as alternative)
- MacOS > Windows, Linux/WSL
- Git ofc.
